# RapidSDK
RapidSDK is a Backend as a Service platform that eliminates the need for app developers to build custom backend solutions for their apps. Development of server-side components is expensive, repetitive, and distracts from perfecting your app. Let RapidSDK handle it so you can focus on making your app awesome.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Any system that can edit PHP files.

### Installing
Fork the repository and `git pull` onto your local machine. Then, in a command prompt, type `php crud.php`.

### First Steps
Firstly, you must change the `apiKey` and `apiSecret` located in the `crud.php` file to be your `apiKey` and `apiSecret` from the [Mobile Dashboard](http://mobile.rapidsdk.com). You also must have cURL installed on your local machine.
